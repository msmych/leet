<h1><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/">30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words</a></h1>
<h1><code style="color: red">hard</code></h1>
<h3><code>Hash Table | Two Pointers | String</code></h3>
<p>You are given a string, <strong>s</strong>, and a list of words, <strong>words</strong>, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in <strong>s</strong> that is a concatenation of each word in <strong>words</strong> exactly once and without any intervening characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:
  s =</strong> "barfoothefoobarman",
<strong>  words = </strong>["foo","bar"]
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>[0,9]</code>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:
  s =</strong> "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
<strong>  words = </strong>["word","good","best","word"]
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>[]</code>
</pre>
