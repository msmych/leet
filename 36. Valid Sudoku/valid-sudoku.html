<small>A partially filled sudoku which is valid.</small></p>

<p>The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character <code>'.'</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
[
&nbsp; ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
&nbsp; ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
&nbsp; [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
&nbsp; ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
&nbsp; ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
&nbsp; ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
&nbsp; [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
&nbsp; [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
&nbsp; [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Same as Example 1, except with the <strong>5</strong> in the top left corner being 
    modified to <strong>8</strong>. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.</li>
	<li>Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned&nbsp;rules.</li>
	<li>The given board&nbsp;contain only digits <code>1-9</code> and the character <code>'.'</code>.</li>
	<li>The given board size is always <code>9x9</code>.</li>
</ul>
